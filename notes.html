<h2> Shiva </h2>

             <p>
My mind is rage; My soul is love, <br>

My mind looks forward; My soul, above, <br>

My mind is fear; My soul is joy, <br>

My mind sees a threat; My soul sees a toy. <br>

My mind interprets; My soul understands, <br>

My mind, clenched fists; My soul, open hands, <br>

My mind knows my soul; My soul knows my mind, <br>

My mind takes control; My Soul knows it blind. <br>

My mind is a horse; My soul pulls the reins, <br>

My mind tries to bolt; My soul soothes its pain, <br>

My mind is a child; lost in the dark; <br>

My soul is a candle; my soul is a spark. <br>

My mind starts to trust; My soul gently flies, <br>

My mind starts to see; My soul itâ€™s new eyes, <br>

My mind will follow; My soul will lead, <br>

My mind is at peace; My soul has been freed. <br>

II slept when it rained yesterday  <br>

and today, my insomniac heart is bruised raw  <br>

with the blue of the morning.  <br>

I read the pages of November sky glistening   <br>

like the purwai-kissed cheeks of the dark one.  <br>

With my desires catching cold, after being let out in the open,  <br>

I leave the debate of metaphysics to the bees.  <br>

The dream is too ravishing to open these eyes  <br>

but he, who wanders in the forests,   <br>

tells me that dancing in the ruins of a dream  <br>

for too long slips poison in the gap   <br>

between I and I-lessness.  <br>

Once again I gargle with warm salt water  <br>

and spit out one moon after another  <br>

to empty my throat of the heat that spread throughout   <br>
after I drank the poison of eighty-four lakh lives   <br>

without hearing the sweet notes of his flute.  <br>

O beloved of the cosmos!  <br>

Tell me how will this frail infinitude  <br>

survive the violence of its own loveliness?  <br>

I have a small voice  <br>

and can only talk of small things.  <br>

I may be a fool but I'm not dead.  <br>

I dare the hours to peel me  <br>

until I remain no more than a cry of anguish,  <br>

burning in the fever of this cyclic malady of lives and deaths.  <br>

The hiss of dreams boiling at the border  <br>

separating an oblivion from another  <br>

no longer scares me.  <br>

Bewildered by his games,  <br>

I repeatedly jump into the same dream,  <br>

shedding faces after faces.  <br>

That elusive trickster!  <br>

It's a clear November morning  <br>

but I hunger to dislodge the moon  <br>

behind his ear and brush dark from his knotted curls

before I'm tossed again  <br>

to suffer in the sea of forgetfulness and sleep.  <br>
